# meanSquaredDisplacement

## Purpose

Computes the mean squared displacement of particles along a trajectory.
It takes the periodic boundary counditions into account.

## How to compile it

You need to install `scons`, which is a newer and better and easier equivalent to the much complicated `make`.
Please visit [the scons website](www.scons.org) for download, or you should better use your repositories.  
Under Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install scons`  
Under Fedora: `sudo yum install scons`  
and so on for other distros.

Once you're in the directory where you downloaded `meanSquaredDisplacement`, just type  
```
$ scons
```  
In a nutshell, scons will look at the file called `SConstruct` I built for you and compile everything smartly.

Of course, you may compile the simple fortran file(s) by yourself if you prefer the complicated ways.

## How to use meanSquaredDisplacement

### Inputs
All you need is a file, whatever its name, containing all your positions in a format  
``` 
x(1,t) y(1,t) z(1,t)  
x(2,t) y(2,t) z(2,t)  
x(i,t) y(i,t) z(i,t)  
...    
x(Nat,t) y(Nat,t) z(Nat,t)    
x(1,t+1) y(1,t+1) z(1,t+1)  
x(2,t+1) y(2,t+1) z(2,t+1)  
x(i,t+1) y(i,t+1) z(i,t+1)  
...  
x(Nat,t+1) y(Nat,t+1) z(Nat,t+1)  
...  
...  
x(Nat,t+Nstep) y(Nat,t+Nstep) z(Nat,t+Nstep)  
```  

where `Nat` is the total number of atoms you have in your supercell,  
and `Nstep` is the number of timesteps in your trajectory.

In other words, you print the coordinates of all sites for a given timestep, then for the next one, etc.  
You do not print blank lines anywhere. You can add as many spaces you want between the columns.

At the end, you *must* have 3 columns and `Nat x Nstep` rows.

That's all you need.

## Execution

The executable is waiting for arguments:  
1. `Lz`, the length of the supercell in *x* direction, in the same units as the positions  
2. `Ly`  
3. `Lz`  
4. `Nat`, defined above  
5. `filename` of the trajectory in the format discussed above.  
  
So, you have to execute:  
`$ meanSquaredDisplacement 56.0 37.43 288.1 800 ./analysis/MSD/positions.out`

## Outputs

Execution of `meanSquaredDisplacement` will result in a single file: `msd.out`.  
This file has a very simple ASCII format:
    1 1.12931233  
    2 1.24034134  
    3 1.5908O123  
    ...  
    Nstep 123987.12383  
where the first column is the timestep, and the second column is the mean squared displacement.  

### Units
Both timesteps and mean squared displacement are in units of your simulation.  
If your trajectory file contains milliseconds (ms) and (Angstroms), `msd.out` will be in `ms AngstromsÂ²`.


## Disclaimer

This program has been thoroughly tested and validated.
I would not share a tool that is not production ready. I am very confident in this program.
*Nevertheless*, this program may contain bugs or restrictions that would lead to unexpected results.
Please, read carefully this readme file, and test it thoroughly on data for which you already know the results.
